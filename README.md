# Online Shopping Website

## Project Overview
The **Online Shopping Website** is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It simplifies online shopping operations by providing two distinct modes: **User** and **Admin**. The User mode allows browsing products, placing orders, and making payments, while the Admin mode enables the management of products, orders, and user accounts.

### Admin Mode
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products (name, price, stock, images).
- **Order Management**: View, update, and manage customer orders.
- **User Management**: View user profiles and order histories.

### User Mode
- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse products, filter, and sort them by category, price, and rating.
- **Cart Management**: Add or remove items from the cart and update quantities.
- **Secure Payment**: Pay using Stripe integration with both card and cash-on-delivery options.
- **Place Order**: User can place order.
- **Order Tracking**: View order status and history in the user profile.

## Features
- **Admin Panel**: Full control over products, users, and orders.
- **User Interface**: Clean, user-friendly design built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Secure Payments**: Stripe integration for safe and secure transactions.
- **Email Notifications**: Order confirmation and password reset emails via Nodemailer.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Fully deployed on Vercel (frontend) and MongoDB Atlas (backend).
- **Authentication**: User authentication using Passport JS and JWT.
